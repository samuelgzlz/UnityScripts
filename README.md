# UnityScripts
Scripts I created for tools I found myself needing inside Unity.


Will update each time a new script is added.

##Scripts

1. Material Reassigner: Pick a prefab on the editor or scene and apply the selected material with one click.
2. Object Distributor: This script creates a window that will allow you to distribute objects on any axis with the value you assign.
